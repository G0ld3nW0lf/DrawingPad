This program is a simple drawing pad. As of right now the 
drawing pad uses a grid system. In the future I plan to remove
the limitations of the grid and make it so that the resolution of the
pictures can be higher. 

As of now the user can open and save pictures that they make. They can
also choose the color of their pen.
